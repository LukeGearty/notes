File Systems have 3 requirements:
It must be possible to store a very large amount of information
The information must survive termination of process using it
Multiple processes must be able to access information concurrently

File System can be thought of as a disk: a linear sequence of fixed-size blocks supporting read and write operations

File Implementation

File Naming:
What is the meaning of a file without reading it? The extension.
Ex: 
.bak = backup
.html = hypertext markup language 
.o = object file, compiler output, not yet linked

File Structure:
A sequence of Bytes
A sequence of records 
A Tree
