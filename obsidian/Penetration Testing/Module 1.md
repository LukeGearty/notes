# Penetration Tester's Mindset and Motivation

There are two ways of solving problems:
1. Follow a defined strategy, be thorough, methodical, recording all data, maintaining organization, and improving proces to maximize efficiency
2. Experimenting, thinking outside the box, being pragmatic, flexible, break habits and don't think like atraditional IT administrator or developer
	1. There may not be a playbook for problems that you come across
You will need to utilize both simultaneously to be a succesful penetration tester
Learning to think like an attacker so we can help protect our systems from the threats to our security

Penetration Testing is intended to help a system owner get vulnerabilities patched before bad guys exploit them. 
Manage and reduce risk to a customer, system or organization
Help make the case for a higher security budget.
Find vulnerabilities, validating them through exploitation, and demonstrating the impact.

Presenting discoveries in a report:
- A penetration test ends with a report to the system owner
- Report details the risk of all findings and may provide mitigation recommendations
- Risk may be explained in business or mission impact, accounting for the value of the assets
	- May be protecting financial data to physical safety and lives
