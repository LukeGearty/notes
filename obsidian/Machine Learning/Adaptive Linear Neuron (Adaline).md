A network with a single linear unit
Bipolar activation function for its input signals and output

x_0 = 1, always = 1, bias

x_1, x_2, ... x_n are inputs, need to calculate y_in

w_1, w_2, ... w_n are weights

Has an activation function, along with a quantizer

Activation function - the function that gives us a value to work with the threshold function - works using weights of the features.

Cost function - function that every machine learning algo will be working to minimize so that it can give accurate results. Measures how wrong a model's predictions are. Perceptron does not have a cost function, but Adaline does.
