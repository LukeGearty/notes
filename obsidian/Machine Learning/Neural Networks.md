Composed of node layers

  
Input layer

Hidden layer

Output layer

  

Each node usues a linear regression model

Weights of connection between nodes determines how much influence each input has on output

Each node has input data, weights, bias, threshold, and then ouput

  

Data is passed between nodes feed forward

  

Our predicted outcome is known as y_hat

  

Rely on training data to improve accuracy over time

Evaluates based on a cost function
