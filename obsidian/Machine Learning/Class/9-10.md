VC-Dimension - relates to model capacity
- Given N data points and 2^n different binary classification problems, the hypothesis class is able to find a solution for all cases.
	- Then, H shatters N points. VC dimension is N
- It means for N points, we can find at least one layout of examples for which we can solve all 2^n problems.
- E.g VC dimension of line hypothesis class is 3 in two dimensions.

Role of Validation Set
- Used to find the best parameters for a given training method, used to diagnose in an overfitting or underfitting scenario (Underfitting - model is too simple to capture patterns, overfitting is when model is too complex and "memorizes" training data but performs poorly on new data)
- High traning error, high validation error -> high bias (underfitting)
- Low training error, high validation error -> high variance (overfitting)

Most General and Most Specific Hypothesis
In the rectangles, the most specific is the one closest to the positive examples, while most general is closest to negative examples without going in. 

# Perceptron

- Initially motivated by neuron structure in the human brain.
- Building block in today's deep neural networks.


# Gradient Descent
