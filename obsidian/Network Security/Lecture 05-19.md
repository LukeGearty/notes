# Lecture 1
Security Basics
Homework #1 - Due 18 Aug
Lab #1 - Due on June 8

Computer and Network Security is focused on preventing undesired behavior

Need to think differently - edge cases. How can an attacker try to exploit this?

Security Mindset
	What is the system designed to do? What is the proper operation?
	The system is typically larger than just the computer or network. For example:
		a website has a frontend, backend, database, etc.
	What are the vulnerabilities in the system? How can this be attacked?



Bonus Exercises: Due 2PM before next class
Exercise #1 -
Suppose you have a database with a password. What are some ways to "hack" into the account? That is, how would you figure out the username/password?
	Guess the password until you get it right
	Try to trick a user into giving the password
	Try to exploit the logic of the database to get around the password

Exercise #2
What happens when a TCP RST attack is sent with the wrong SEQ/ACK # to the target?
The target ignores it with a wrong SEQ/ACK #

Exercise #3
Introduce yourself in slack

Exercise # A
Describe a recent cybersecurity incident you read about in the news. Explain the incident, the vulnerabilities exploited, and the impact of the attack. What measures could have been taken to prevent this attack? Please limit response to no more than 100 words.
