Computer/Network Security: focused on preventing undesired behavior

Security Mindset: Thinking of what the system is designed to do and what the proper operation of the system. Thinking of the vulnerabilities, and how it can be defended. Thinking of the cost of defense.

CIA - Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
Confidentiality: prevent unauthorized reading of information
Integrity: prevent unauthorized changing of information
Availability: Data is available in a timely manner when needed

Risk Analysis and Management
Risk: something of value (asset) that may lose value if a negative event occurs
Threat: any potential occurrence, malicious or otherwise, that can have an adverse effect on the assets/resources associated with the system
Vulnerability: some characteristic that makes it possible for a threat to occur
Attack/Exploit: some actin that involves exploitation of some vulnerability to cause an existing threat to occur

Risk Analysis: Identifying assets, putting quantitative or qualitative measures on the likelihood of the event happening, putting quantitative or qualitiative measures on the consequences of the potential loss

Risk Management:
	Risk Avoidance: avoiding the risk 
	Risk Mitigation: minimizing the potential impact of the risk
	Risk Transfer: transferring the risk to another party
	Risk Acceptance: Risk is low but costly to mitigate - worth accepting. Monitor

Quantitative:
Exposure Factor (EF) = Percentage of asset loss caused by identified threat
Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) = asset value X Exposure Factor
Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO) = Estimated frequency a threat will occur within a year
Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) = SLE x ARO
