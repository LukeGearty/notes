33 Questions
130 minutes
Bonus Question - make sure you know something about the professor (hint)
Covers Ch 4, 5 (Network Layer), 6 (link layer), and 8(marginally covered) (you won't have to know the mathematics behind it, but know what it is)
Take a look at the slides for each chapter

Multiple choice
Square box - matching
Write in an answer - type in - the question will give the format for these

Subnet question - you will have to do everything by hand
Dijkstra's Algorithm question - graph with 7 to 8 nodes, full table like in the book

Scheduling Questions - a table where a number of packets arrive and the time they arrive, you have to answer what time they will leave based on the scheduling algorithm - know the scheduling algorithm

Binary to decimal conversion
Pen to Paper:
	Subnetting
	IP Fragmentation
	Dijkstra's Algorithm
	Scheduling Algorithms

Need to know:
Chapter 8:
8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.6, 8.8, look at slides 
The end to end argument - 361 - 363 in text
The dijkstra's algorithm, bellman-ford (Distance Vector)
Distance Vector versus Link State - 
potential risks for distance vector - fake link costs for distance vector algorithm can propagate for example (not the case for link state). Count to infinity problem.
Software Defined Networking - an idea of the components 
ICMP - general idea

OSPF/BGP:
	Autonomous Systems

Chapter 6:
Error Checking
	Parity Checks
	Checksums
	Cyclic Redundancy Check

Multiple Access Protocols:
	Channel Partitioning
	Random Access Protocols - ALOHA, Slotted ALOHA
	Taking Turns Protocols

Section 6.7 

Don't need to know:
1. Each of the steps for TLS
2. Middleboxes don't show up on the exam
3. Pseudo code for the algorithms
4. Don't need to know Bellman-ford by heart
5. Run time of the algorithms - it is O(N squared)
6. Don't need to know about the architecture of the SDN - controller, protocols, etc.
7. Netconf and Yang - not too much detail
8. You won't have to do a CRC calculation
9. Probability of Random Access Protocols, exponential backoff exact calculations
10.
