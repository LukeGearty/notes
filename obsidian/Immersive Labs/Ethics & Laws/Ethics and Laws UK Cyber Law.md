### **Real-Life Law vs. Online Confusion**

- In physical life, laws are clear: no stealing, vandalism, or using others' personal property (e.g. passports).
    
- People usually do the right thing (e.g. returning lost items).
    
- Online, the same **laws and principles apply**, but boundaries are often misunderstood or ignored.
    
- Digital crimes can leave victims feeling **helpless, unaware**, or **self-blaming**.
