### **Hacking vs. Burglary – Notes**

---

#### **The Digital World as Personal Space**

- Online spaces are **personal and valuable**, much like physical homes.
    
- People store:
    
    - Personal info
        
    - Social media data
        
    - Private messages
        
    - Games and digital assets
        
- These spaces represent **emotional and personal investment**.

#### **Emotional Impact**

- **Hacking** can feel like a **violation**, similar to a home **burglary**.
    
- Examples:
    
    - Losing digital game characters/coins = like having valuable items stolen from home.
        
    - Unauthorized access to private online spaces = like someone invading your room.

#### **Why the Comparison Makes Sense**

- We form **attachments** to both **digital possessions** and **physical items**.
    
- Losing digital assets can trigger the same **emotional response** as losing physical ones.
    
- **Online identity and presence** have value—sentimental, social, and sometimes financial.
