### **Attribution & Accountability – Notes**

#### **Summary**

- **Attribution**: Identifying **who or what** caused a specific issue or action.
    
- **Accountability**: Holding entities **responsible** for actions or inactions.
    

> Both are critical in cybersecurity to determine the **source of breaches**, enforce **responsibility**, and shape **security policies**.

---

### **What is Attribution?**

- Identifies the **origin of security threats** or failures.
    
- Can be linked to:
    
    - **Cybercriminals** (e.g., known threat actors).
        
    - **Internal issues** (e.g., misconfigured security controls).
        

---

### **What is Accountability?**

- Holding **individuals, teams, or organizations** responsible for security-related tasks and failures.
    
- Involves:
    
    - Creating and enforcing **clear policies**.
        
    - Measuring performance against **expectations**.
        
- Acts like **CI/CD** in software: **continuous accountability** improves defenses over time.
    

---

### **Non-repudiation**

- Ensures that a person **cannot deny ownership or responsibility**.
    
- Example: A **signed contract** is a form of non-repudiation.
    

---

### **Impact of Attribution & Accountability**

- Enables:
    
    - **Threat identification**
        
    - **Enforcement of consequences**
        
    - **Policy refinement**
        
    - **Pattern recognition** in security failures
        
- Crucial for **prevention**, **response**, and **future resilience**.

### **In Application Security (AppSec)**

- Attribution examples:
    
    - Developers using **default security settings** or skipping checks can be identified by their work environments.
        
- Accountability examples:
    
    - Staff responsible for a breach may be reprimanded or disciplined under internal policies.
        
    - Organizations can face **legal or financial consequences** for inadequate controls or responses.

### **Real-World Example: Bupa (March 2017)**

- **Cause**: Employee extracted data from **547,000 global customers** and sent it to his personal email.
    
- **Attribution**: Traced to the employee via activity logs.
    
- **Accountability**:
    
    - Employee was **fired** and law enforcement issued an **arrest warrant**.
        
    - **Fine**: £175,000 by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).
        
- **Preventable?**: Yes—by monitoring activity logs (SWAN system).

### **Conclusion**

- **Attribution** helps **trace** responsibility.
    
- **Accountability** ensures **consequences** and improvement.
    
- Together, they reinforce **stronger cybersecurity postures** and enable **effective response and prevention**.
