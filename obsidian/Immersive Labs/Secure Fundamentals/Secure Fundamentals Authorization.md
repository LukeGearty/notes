### **Authorization - Notes**

#### **Definition**

- **Authorization** determines if an entity has sufficient permissions or privileges to perform a specific action on a system.
    
- Ensures **only trusted entities** are allowed to perform actions.
    

#### **Process**

- If the entity **has sufficient permissions**, the action proceeds.
    
- If **not**, an appropriate **error message** is returned.
    

#### **Relationship with Authentication**

- **Authentication** and **Authorization** are **distinct but related**.
    
- **Authentication precedes authorization**: you must first confirm the entityâ€™s identity before checking its permissions.
