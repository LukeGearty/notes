## **Key Controls in the Access Control Family**

1. **Policy and Procedures**
    
    - Define how access control measures are implemented.
        
2. **Account Management**
    
    - Create, modify, delete accounts
        
    - Define account permissions
        
    - Monitor account activity
        
3. **Access Enforcement**
    
    - Control subjectsâ€™ access to information and resources.
        
4. **Information Flow Enforcement**
    
    - Regulates _where_ information can travel internally and externally.
        
5. **Separation of Duties**
    
    - Split responsibilities to reduce misuse risks.
        
6. **Least Privilege (PoLP)**
    
    - Grant only necessary permissions to perform job functions.
        
7. **Unsuccessful Logon Attempts**
    
    - Trigger actions (e.g., lock account, alert admin) after multiple failed attempts.
        
8. **System Use Notification**
    
    - Pre-login message/banner with privacy and usage policies.
        
9. **Previous Logon Notification**
    
    - Inform user of the last account access time/date.
        
10. **Concurrent Session Control**
    
    - Limit number of active sessions per account.
        
11. **Device Lock**
    
    - Auto-lock devices after inactivity or when unattended.
        
12. **Session Termination**
    
    - Auto-end sessions under certain conditions (e.g., inactivity).
        
13. **Permitted Actions Without ID/Auth**
    
    - Allow certain actions without full authentication.
        
14. **Security and Privacy Attributes**
    
    - Assign attributes to entities (e.g., files marked confidential).
        
15. **Remote Access**
    
    - Control access from external networks.
        
16. **Wireless Access**
    
    - Regulate access via wireless technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).
        
17. **Access Control for Mobile Devices**
    
    - Set rules for organizational mobile device use.
        
18. **Use of External Systems**
    
    - Manage risks from non-organizational systems and devices.
        
19. **Information Sharing**
    
    - Control sharing of sensitive data like PII.
        
20. **Publicly Accessible Content**
    
    - Prevent exposure of non-public data on public systems.
        
21. **Data Mining Protection**
    
    - Detect/prevent unauthorized data mining of stored data.
        
22. **Access Control Decisions**
    
    - Enforce allow/deny decisions on every access request.
        
23. **Reference Monitor**
    
    - Core OS component that enforces access control policies; cannot be bypassed.

## **Implementation and Prioritization**

- Prioritize controls in **high-impact security control baselines**.
    
- Alternatively, conduct **risk assessments** to determine critical controls.
    
- Refer to **NIST SP 800-53** for detailed implementation guidance.
