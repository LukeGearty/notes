### **Exploitation Phase Overview**

- **Definition**: First attempt to execute code or trigger events on the target system.
    
- **Primary Methods**:
    
    1. **User Interaction**:
        
        - Requires user to initiate exploitation (e.g., clicking a malicious file or URL).
            
        - Common delivery method: email.
            
    2. **Service Exploitation**:
        
        - No user interaction required.
            
        - Exploits vulnerabilities in:
            
            - Network devices.
                
            - Software services (via specially crafted payloads).

### **Post-Exploitation Actions**

- **Attacker Capabilities**:
    
    - Various actions depending on the attack objective.
        
    - Some actions follow the Cyber Kill Chain stages, but not always.
        
- **Examples**:
    
    - **Ransomware Attacks**:
        
        - May skip persistence or C2 communication.
            
        - Rely on the victim contacting attackers.
            
    - **Credential Leaks**:
        
        - May be reused in later or separate attacks.
            
        - Can initiate a new, related kill chain.

### **Lab Instructions**

- **Objective**: Investigate a cyber incident using logs in Splunk.
    
- **Incident Type**: Brute force attack on a **Joomla web application**.
    
- **Steps**:
    
    1. Filter logs for **HTTP POST requests** containing:
        
        - `"username"`
            
        - `"passwd"`
            
    2. Further refine search with specific usernames:
        
        - Example: `imthebatman`
