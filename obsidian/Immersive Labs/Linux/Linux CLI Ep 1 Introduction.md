### **Linux CLI: Ep.1 – Introduction to the Linux Command Line Interface**

#### **What is the Command Line Interface (CLI)?**

- A **text-based** way to interact with a computer system.
    
- Also called: **terminal**, **console**, or **shell**.
    
- Replaces the need for a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**.
    
- Still widely used in **Linux** and by **cybersecurity professionals**.
    

#### **History**

- Dominant interface from the **1960s** until GUIs emerged (Mac OS, Windows).
    
- CLI remains a **core tool** in cybersecurity and Linux operations.

### **The Terminal**

- The tool used to access the CLI in Linux.
    
- Upon opening, you’ll see the **command prompt**:
    
    ruby
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `linux@commandline-intro:~$`
    

#### **Prompt Breakdown:**

- `linux` – **Username**
    
- `commandline-intro` – **Computer name (hostname)**
    
- `~` – **Current directory** (tilde `~` is the home directory)
    
- `$` – **Privilege level**
    
    - `$` = **Standard user**
        
    - `#` = **Root (admin) user**

### **Commands**

- Used to perform actions (e.g., open files, navigate directories, change permissions).
    
- Not all commands show visible output immediately.
    
    - Example: Changing permissions won’t show feedback, but changes appear with `ls -l`.

### **Why Use the CLI Instead of a GUI?**

- **Faster and more flexible** for professionals.
    
- Reduces time vs. navigating GUI menus.
    
- Critical for:
    
    - **Cybersecurity roles**
        
    - **Developers**
        
    - **System administrators**

### **Benefits of Learning CLI**

- Foundation for more advanced cybersecurity skills.
    
- Used in both **offensive** and **defensive** cyber tasks.
    
- Adds value even outside cybersecurity—shows technical skill to employers.
